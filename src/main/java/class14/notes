Types of variables:
   There are three types of variables in Java
   with respect to scope /visibility/accessibility
   1) local
   2)instance
   3)static

Local Variables:
  Local varaiables are the variables which are defined inside
  the block of code like if-else statement, loop,
  switch-statement methods. They can only be accessed with-in that block of code.


Upside;
 They occupy the memory for least amount of time inside your computer
 You should always try to go with local variables.

DownSide:
  They can only be accessed with-in the same block where they
  are created.

Instance Variables;
  The variables which are defined inside a class but outside a block of code
  like method if-else statement ,loop ,switch etc. are called as instance
  variables. They can be accessed anywhere in the class expect static methods.

Upside:
  They can be accessed anywhere inside a class other than static methods.
DownSide:
  They occupy the memory for longer as compared to a local variable.

Static Variables:
  static variables are created static keyword they are also created outside of blocks
  of code like methods, loops etc.
Upside:
   we can save a lot of space because for static only one memory location is used for all the object.

Downside:
   It occupies the memory for longest.

Access Modifiers:
   Access modifiers in java help us the control who can access what. There are 4 accesses
   levels and we use three keywords to control these levels ,private ,default,protected and public.

Private:
  is the most restricted one when used with a variable or method those cant be accessed outside of that

Important Note:
  1) 99% of the methods are public
  2) 99% of the instance fields are created as private
  3) 99% of static fields are public
  4)
