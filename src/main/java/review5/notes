Arrays
arrays are collection of items .items arre stored based on the indexes
when we store the first item an index zero is assigned to it.
We can use this index to access the elements back from the arrey


Why we should learn arrays
1) Whith help of arrays it is possible to store and manipulate large amounts
of data using loops wich was not possible with variables

Limitations of Enhanced Loop:
1) We can't skip items
2) We can't go in backward direction.
3) We can't update the item in the array.
