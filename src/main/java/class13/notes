Methods in Java
    Methods/ Function/ Behaviours are blocks of code.
    They contain statement (lines of code)
     which are executed when a method is called.
     A method in java has a return type(output) name and
     parameters/ arguments(inputs).


Why we should use methods?
    Methods help us reuse the code. When we need to share
    or reuse a piece of code within our project or with others
    we can create our own classes define methods inside those classes and
    we can start reusing /sharing them.

Syntax of the methods:
   returnType(output) nameOfTheMethod (input/argument/parameters){
