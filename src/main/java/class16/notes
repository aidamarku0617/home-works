Inheritance:
   Inheritance allows us to build classes from existing classes.
   We can inherit fields and methods from existing classes if we need them in other classes.

There are 5 major types of inheritance.
    1) Single Inheritance.//one parent one child
    2)Hierarchical Inheritance.//one parent several childs
    3)Multilevel Inheritance.//class under classes
