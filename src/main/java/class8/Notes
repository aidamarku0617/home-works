Arrays:
its a collection of similar items .The data is stored in
consecutive memory inside the memory. W use indexing to store
 and access the data in an array. Evrey element that we store
  in an array is assigned a number these numbers start
   from 0 first element will be assigned number 0 then
   next one 1 and so on.
 Why we should usde arrays:
 Its not feasible to use variables for large
 amounts of data.
 Storing menaging searching large amounts of data becomes
 easiser with arrays and loops.
Syntax of Arrays:
we can create arrays in two ways
1) Datatype[] nameofArray={item1,item2,item3};
String[] names={"Kawoon" "Patric" "Halil"}
//index is 2,, size is 3 (for string up)
2) DataType[] nameOfArray=new DataType[size];
int[] nummbers=new int[5];
